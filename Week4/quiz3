Given an intermediate node with 6 safe loans and 3 risky loans, if the min_node_size parameter is 10, what should the tree learning algorithm do next? 
Create a leaf and return it

Assume an intermediate node has 6 safe loans and 3 risky loans. For each of 4 possible features to split on, the error reduction is 0.0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.14, respectively. If the minimum gain in error reduction parameter is set to 0.2, what should the tree learning algorithm do next?
Create a leaf and return it

is the prediction path shorter, longer, or the same as the prediction path using my_decision_tree_old that ignored the early stopping conditions 2 and 3?
Shorter

is the prediction path for a data point always shorter, always longer, always the same, shorter or the same, or longer or the same as for my_decision_tree_old that ignored the early stopping conditions 2 and 3?
Shorter or the same

what is the maximum possible number of splits encountered while making a single prediction?
6

Is the validation error of the new decision tree (using early stopping conditions 2 and 3) lower than, higher than, or the same as that of the old decision tree from the previous assigment? (F)
Lower than

Which tree has the smallest error on the validation data?(F)
model_3

Does the tree with the smallest error in the training data also have the smallest error in the validation data? 
Yes

Which tree has the largest complexity?
model_3

Is it always true that the tree with the lowest classification error on the training set will result in the lowest classification error in the validation set?
No, this is NOT ALWAYS true.

Is it always true that the most complex tree will result in the lowest classification error in the validation_set?
No, this is not always true.

Using the complexity definition, which model (model_4, model_5, or model_6) has the largest complexity?
model_4

model_4 and model_5 have similar classification error on the validation set but model_5 has lower complexity. Should you pick model_5 over model_4?
Pick model_5 over model_4

Using the results obtained in this section, which model (model_7, model_8, or model_9) would you choose to use?
model_8
