Which of the following is NOT an ensemble method?
Single decision trees

Each binary classifier in an ensemble makes predictions on an input x as listed in the table below. Based on the ensemble coefficients also listed in the table, what is the final ensemble model's prediction for x?
-1

(True/False) Boosted decision stumps is a linear classifier.
True -W

(True/False) For AdaBoost, test error is an appropriate criterion for choosing the optimal number of iterations.
False


In an iteration in AdaBoost, recall that learning the coefficient w_t for learned weak learner f_t is calculated by
.79	 -W
0.55

Which of the following classifiers is most accurate as computed on a weighted dataset? A classifier with:
.1

Imagine we are training a decision stump in an iteration of AdaBoost, and we are at a node. Each data point is (x1, x2, y), where x1,x2 are features, and y is the label. Also included are the weights of the data. The data at this node is:
0

After each iteration of AdaBoost, the weights on the data points are typically normalized to sum to 1. This is used because
a

Consider the following 2D dataset with binary labels.
We train a series of weak binary classifiers using AdaBoost. In one iteration, the weak binary classifier produces the decision boundary as follows:
2,3

Suppose we are running AdaBoost using decision tree stumps. At a particular iteration, the data points have weights according the figure. (Large points indicate heavy weights.)
a


(True/False) AdaBoost can boost any kind of classifier, not just a decision tree stump.
True
