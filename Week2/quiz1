(True/False) A linear classifier can only learn positive coefficients.
False

(True/False) In order to train a logistic regression model, we find the weights that maximize the likelihood of the model.
True

(True/False) The data likelihood is the product of the probability of the inputs x given the weights w and response y.
False

Questions 4 and 5 refer to the following scenario.
Consider the setting where our inputs are 1-dimensional. We have data
P(yi=+1|xi,w) = 1/(1+exp(−wTh(xi)))
P(yi=+1|xi,w) = exp(−wTh(xi)/(1+exp(−wTh(xi)))
