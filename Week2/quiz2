Consider four classifiers, whose classification performance is given by the following table:
Classifier 1

Suppose a classifier classifies 23100 examples correctly and 1900 examples incorrectly. Compute accuracy by hand. Round your answer to 3 decimal places.
23100/(25000)
0.924

(True/False) Accuracy and error measured on the same dataset always sum to 1.
True

Which of the following is NOT a correct description of complex models?
Complex models tend to generalize better than simple models.

Which of the following is a symptom of overfitting in the context of logistic regression? Select all that apply.
Large estimated coefficients
Complex decision boundary
Overconfident predictions of class probabilities

Suppose we perform L2 regularized logistic regression to fit a sentiment classifier. Which of the following plots does NOT describe a possible coefficient path? Choose all that apply.
Note. Assume that the algorithm runs for a wide range of L2 penalty values and each coefficient plot is zoomed out enough to capture all long-term trends.
