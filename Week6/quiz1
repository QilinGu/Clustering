T

Which of the following points in the precision-recall space corresponds to this classifier?
3

Which of the following best describes this classifier?
optimistic

Suppose we are fitting a logistic regression model on a dataset where the vast majority of the data points are labeled as positive. To compensate for overfitting to the dominant class, we should
Require higher confidence level for positive predictions

It is often the case that false positives and false negatives incur different costs. In situations where false negatives cost much more than false positives, we should
Require lower confidence level for positive predictions

We are interested in reducing the number of false negatives. Which of the following metrics should we primarily look at?
